
#  Iris Flower Classification

This project is a beginner-friendly machine learning task using the famous **Iris flower dataset**. The objective is to classify iris flowers into three species — *Setosa*, *Versicolor*, and *Virginica* — based on the length and width of their petals and sepals.

##  Dataset Information

The Iris dataset consists of **150 samples** with the following features:

| Feature         | Description           |
|----------------|-----------------------|
| sepal length   | Sepal length in cm    |
| sepal width    | Sepal width in cm     |
| petal length   | Petal length in cm    |
| petal width    | Petal width in cm     |
| species        | Target class (label)  |

Species classes:
- 0 → Setosa
- 1 → Versicolor
- 2 → Virginica
