# ðŸ’» Laptop Price Analysis - Price Regression

## Overview
This project analyzes and predicts laptop prices using a cleaned dataset and various regression techniques. The workflow includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## Features
- Data cleaning and transformation
- Categorical feature encoding
- Linear Regression and (optionally) tree-based models
- Model evaluation with MAE, MSE, RMSE, and RÂ²
- Visualization of actual vs predicted prices and residuals

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd Laptop-Price-Analysis
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**  
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the notebook**  
   Open `laptop_price_regression.ipynb` in Jupyter or VS Code and run all cells.

## Results
- The model predicts laptop prices based on features such as brand, CPU, RAM, storage, and more.
- Evaluation metrics and plots help assess model performance and areas for improvement.

## Next Steps
- Try advanced models (Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Feature selection and engineering
- Hyperparameter tuning
